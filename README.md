Tips
------
If you're unfamiliar with machine learning, and just the concept of machine learning or artificial intelligence, there are TONS of articles and videos online that can give you great explanations. 

Personally, I think this article by MIT is a great one https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained

The first machine learning course I took was <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction">Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course from Coursera</a>. Andrew Ng, does a great job at introducing machine learning, and if you're interested in taking up a course, I would highly suggest to start there.

If you like books, I highly suggest <a href="https://www.janelleshane.com/book-you-look-like-a-thing">Janelle Shane's, You Look Like a Thing and I Love You</a>. This book is an easy to read and FUNNY book about machine learning and artifical intelligence. 

_Knowing how to ask the right questions and think about the next steps is half the battle when debugging or solving these challenges. Google or ChatGPT can handle the other half!_
